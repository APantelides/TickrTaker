There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  Competing auction marketplace for perishable and shortlived assets.

## Summary ##
  Traditional auction marketplaces offer limited performance for selling short lifespan assets such as tickets, expiring rewards points, 'must sell items', ect. Our reverse acution style marketplace helps improve the probability that an item gets purchased/offloaded from the seller. Buyers are also able to prioritize for price versus need within the sellers specified auction parameters. This balance of seller and buyer needs will help drive up the percentage of auction item follow through and reduce waste.

  TLDR
  Get perishable assets you dont want into the hands of the people that do and make a buch or two.
  
## Problem ##
  A seller needs to get rid of a item by a certain date. This item may be thought of as perishable at that date.

## Solution ##
  Improve a sellers ability to offload perishable assets before a deadline by allowing the sale value of the item to decrease over time to improve the chances that the seller will get some value back.
